# DecisionTree
A CART algorithm for an AI presentation

## How is this working?
Simply split up the data into a trainings set (irisTrainData.csv) and a test set (irisTestData.csv) and get started. 
Of course one can name the files to ones liking, just change the name accordingly in the code. ;)

# Warning
This algorithm isn't "perfect". It can be optimized in a lot of ways. 
However, it is fit to be an easy example for showing how to implement a CART algorithm.
